##SUMMARY
The dataset consists of 7,043 customers with features such as demographics, services subscribed, contract type, billing, and payment methods.

The target variable is Churn (Yes/No). Around 26–27% of customers are churners, showing a class imbalance.

Key churn drivers identified:

Contract type: Customers on month-to-month contracts churn far more than those on yearly contracts.

Internet service: Fiber optic users have higher churn compared to DSL.

Additional services (Online Security, Tech Support, Device Protection) reduce churn likelihood.

Payment method: Customers using Electronic Check show higher churn compared to automatic payments.

Tenure: Newer customers (low tenure) are more likely to churn.

Machine learning models (likely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost in your notebook):

Achieved around 78–82% accuracy, with a good balance of precision and recall.

Feature importance highlighted Contract, Tenure, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, and PaymentMethod as most influential.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Encourage long-term contracts
Offer discounts/incentives for customers to switch from month-to-month to annual contracts.

Improve Fiber Optic service quality
Since churn is higher among fiber users, investigate service reliability, speed, or pricing issues.

Bundle value-added services
Promote Online Security, Tech Support, Device Protection as add-ons to increase stickiness and reduce churn.

Targeted retention campaigns

Identify new customers (<6 months tenure) and offer welcome benefits.

Flag customers with electronic check payments for retention offers (e.g., discounts if they switch to auto-pay).

Customer support intervention
Deploy predictive churn scores to proactively reach out to high-risk customers before they cancel.

Continuous monitoring
Retrain churn prediction models quarterly with updated data to keep retention strategies relevant.
