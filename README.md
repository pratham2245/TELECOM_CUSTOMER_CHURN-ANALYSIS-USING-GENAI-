# Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior and identify the key factors influencing customer churn in a telecom company. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and machine learning models, the project aims to:

Understand patterns and drivers of churn (e.g., contract type, tenure, payment method, service usage).

Build predictive models to classify customers as likely to churn or stay.

Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve customer retention, reduce revenue loss, and enhance business decision-making.
